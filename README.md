# Porto

## A reimplementation of pedro barbosas program from 1977

Pedro Barbosas "Porto" is an early example of concrete poetry generated by the computer. It permutates the Portuguese words 'granita', 'saudade', 'pedra', 'historia' with certain prepositions to convey an image of Porto as a city of many layers of sotone, history and emotions.
